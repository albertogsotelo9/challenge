# Fault Tolerance Strategy in Spark

This document outlines the key mechanisms used to ensure fault tolerance and resiliency in Spark-based data processing jobs.

---

## ✅ Node Failure Recovery

- Spark automatically handles **executor failures** by rescheduling tasks on other available nodes.
- Cluster managers like **YARN**, **Kubernetes**, or **Databricks** help maintain cluster resilience and handle node replacement.

---

## ✅ Task Retry Mechanism

- Controlled via `spark.task.maxFailures` (default is 4).
- When a task fails (e.g., due to network or disk I/O), Spark **does not fail the entire job immediately**. It retries the task on another executor.
- Ensures robustness against **transient infrastructure issues**.

---

## ✅ Checkpointing

- Use `.checkpoint()` to persist long lineage RDDs or DataFrames to reliable storage (e.g., DBFS, HDFS).
- Breaks the lineage chain and **improves fault recovery**.
- Benefits:
  - Avoids recomputation of all previous transformations.
  - Makes recovery faster and more reliable.
- Especially useful in **stateful streaming** applications.

---

## ✅ Speculative Execution

- Enable via `spark.speculation=true`.
- Spark runs a **duplicate (speculative) task** for slow-running tasks (due to skew or resource contention).
- Whichever task finishes first is used.
- Helps address **straggler tasks** that delay overall stage completion.

---

## ✅ Job Restart Strategy

- Use orchestration tools like **Airflow**, **Databricks Workflows** to:
  - Detect failures
  - Automatically retry jobs or steps
- Persist **intermediate results** to avoid reprocessing the full pipeline after failure.

---

## ✅ Idempotent Writes

- Ensures data consistency even under retries or failure.
- Implemented by:
  - Writing data in **overwrite mode** or to a **temporary staging location**, then moving to final destination.
  - Avoiding `.mode("append")` unless you're enforcing deduplication.
- Optionally, track written batches in a **write audit log** to avoid duplicate processing.

---

## ✅ Failure Isolation

- Each processing stage (e.g., cleaning, filtering, aggregation) is modularized.
- This allows:
  - Easier debugging and reruns
  - Targeted retries using orchestrators
- Integration with tools like **Airflow DAGs** or **Databricks Job Workflows** makes it possible to retry only failed stages instead of the full pipeline.
